A Django project to test out Google Auth.  For details see my [blog post](https://spockmay.github.io/python-in-the-cloud).

To use:
* python3 -m venv .venv
* source .venv/bin/activate
* pip install -r requirements.txt

Before you are able to login with Google you will need to do configuration on both Google Cloud as well locally within the /admin page of the Django app.
